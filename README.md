# Developer Notes
Compared to my app [cyper](https://github.com/naimulh247/cyper/) this app is very light with a different purpose. The app doesn't have the same anonymity as [cyper](https://github.com/naimulh247/cyper/) and is more public. This app does not use that much dependencies, few relating cookies, mongodb, and express.
